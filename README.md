## Project Name
Z-STAR: Zero-shot Style Transfer via Attention Rearrangement (Reweighting)

## Introduction
Z-STAR is an innovative zero-shot (training-free) style transfer method that leverages the generative prior knowledge within a pre-trained diffusion model. By employing an attention rearrangement strategy, it effectively fuses content and style information without the need for retraining or tuning for each input style.

## Main Contributions
- A zero-shot image style transfer method that does not require retraining or tuning.
- A rearranged attention mechanism for disentangling and fusing content/style information in the diffusion latent space.
  
## Installation
```shell
# Comming soon.
```

## Usage
```shell
python main.py --content_image <path_to_content_image> --style_image <path_to_style_image>
```
